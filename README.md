# DGM-EIT

In this article, we compare the performances of three conditional generative models on the inverse problem of EIT imaging from three perspectives. Please see our article for the details if intersted.

The code for the CVAE is based on [JIN KEUN SEO's work](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/18M1222600), the CNF is based on [Alexander Denker's work](https://github.com/jleuschn/cinn_for_imaging), the CSD^* is based on [Yang Song's work](https://github.com/yang-song/score_sde). We are very grateful for the groundwork they provideÔºÅ

We provide a small data file of samples containing 4 anomalies with a noise of 40 dB in the data folder.
